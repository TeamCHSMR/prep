App that helps you find balance and a healthy headspace as a developer. The dev mind you've been waiting for. We are on a mission to make healthier devs so they can build a better world.

## What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)

- Forgetting to take breaks and sitting for hours on end.

- Getting into a negative mental space when you get stuck on a problem or overwhelmed.

- Focusing on overall health.

- Preventing developer burnout.

- Overall emphasis is that the application needs to be inviting and easy to use.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition

* Login/logout feature with user profile

* Break reminder that is customizable so you can set intervals for break notifications (persists)

* Could change site dark/light theme (persists)

* quick mental reset option / exercise (could include a short breathing technique, short video, inspirational quote, something funny)

* Rubby ducky programming option (select this to literally talk to a "rubber duck")

* Hungry? input zip code and feature connects to yelps api and helps user find meal (zip code persists)


STRETCH GOALS:

* Song suggestions for coding based on mood? (could pull from spotify api)
